# CRUS_Sieve

# I will upload any sieve files here. ATM I have one deep search running (P=20T). The srsieve has nothing to do, so I decided to 
# "pre-sieve" some bases.
# The "pre-sieve" will go to P=50B,  higher values are much faster with sr(n)sieve. 
# Any other informations can you find at mersenneforum.org
